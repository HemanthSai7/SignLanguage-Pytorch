# SignLanguage-Pytorch
I made this project when I articipated in [Task Mate Kenyan Sign Language Classification Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/kenyan-sign-language-classification-challenge).

## Description
A common misconception of sign language is that it is the same everywhere; in reality there are as many as 300 different languages (approximately 50 of these from Africa) with new signs evolving each day as a need appears. Kenyan Sign Language (KSL) is used in Kenya and Somalia, and there are different dialects depending on what region you are in. It is used by over half of Kenya's estimated 600 000-strong deaf population.

The objective of this competition is to build a model to recognise ten different everyday KSL signs present in the images, using machine learning or deep learning algorithms.
